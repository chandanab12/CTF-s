## RSA 

When n,e,c or p,q values are given and you need to decrypt a msg 

import gmpy2 
#gmpy2 is a library that is used for easy calculations 
e =
p =
q =
n = p*q
c = [ ] #enter encrypted msg here if you have it 
phi = (p-1) * (q-1)
d = gmpy2.invert(e,phi)
print(d)

for i in c:
 m= pow(i,d,n)
 print(chr(m)) 

print("")
